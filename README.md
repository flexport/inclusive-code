#### Why

Flexportâ€™s vision is to unite the world in a seamless web of commerce where itâ€™s easy, affordable and predictable for companies to buy and sell products in any market, anywhere on Earth. To build the best possible product for a diverse, global audience, we need a diverse set of makers enabled to do their best work. 

In pursuit of creating an environment where everyone can do their best work, we will strive to avoid using terminology that is derogatory, hurtful, or perpetuates discrimination, either directly or indirectly [ref](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/respectful-code). We acknowledge that the tech industry does not accurately reflect population demographics, and as a result there is established terminology that is harmful to underrepresented groups. 

For example, using â€˜whitelistâ€™ and â€˜blacklistâ€™ as shorthand for positive/good/allowed and negative/bad/denied is an established pattern in the industry. For people who are constantly dealing with the reality of those cultural connotations, seeing them reinforced in the codebase can be harmful. Similarly, using phrases like â€˜sanity checkâ€™ and â€˜insaneâ€™ evokes ableist stereotypes for non-neurotypical people.

We believe we can do our best work by welcoming the most diverse set of makers possible, and so we embrace the change that comes with them.

#### Scope

This style guide applies but is not limited to:
* All internal code, in all languages
  * Includes variables, methods, data models, files, and classes
  * Does not include external libraries and generated files
* Tests and test cases
* Comments and documentation inside and outside the codebase
* UIs and APIs, internals and output
* Commit messages, PR descriptions, and code reviews
* Data storage: table names, columns, etc.

#### Guiding Principles [ref](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/respectful-code)

Be respectful: Derogatory language shouldnâ€™t be necessary to describe how things work.
Use culturally appropriate language: Some words might have significant historical or political meanings. Please consider this and use alternatives.

#### Examples

Though this is not comprehensive, in general we want to avoid using language that is racist, ableist, or gendered.

Example of writing that is racist

ðŸš« value "WHITELISTED", "The value is currently whitelisted by a switch"
ðŸš« value "BLACKLISTED", "The value is currently blacklisted by a switch"

âœ… value "ALLOWLISTED", "The value is currently allowlisted by a switch"
âœ… value "BLOCKLISTED", "The value is currently blocklisted by a switch"

Example of writing that is ableist

ðŸš« def sanity_check_dockerfiles(dockerfiles)

âœ… def check_dockerfiles(...)

Example of writing that is gendered

ðŸš« This is the measurement of man-hours and touchpoints across the bill ingestion processâ€¦

âœ… This is the measurement of working-hours and touchpoints across the bill ingestion processâ€¦

#### Flagged Terms and Alternatives

Term | Suggested Alternative(s)
-----|----------------------------
whitelist/blacklist | Allowlist/blocklist, Includelist/excludelist
master/slave | Leader/follower, Primary/secondary, Primary/replica, Parent/child
master | Main, original, primary
master data | Main data, reference data
redline | Priority line, exception, anomaly
sanity check | Check, validity check, make sure youâ€™re using types correctly, sensibile/reasonable/reasonability check
crippled | Slowed, overloaded 
grandfathered | Exempt, legacy
dummy | Placeholder, mock
gendered pronouns | They, them, their
man-in-the-middle | On-path attack, person-in-the-middle
first-class citizen | First class concern/concept, core concern, built in, top-level 

#### Industry Term Exemption

It occurs that some flagged terms are a part of deeply ingrained freight industry jargon.  For example, the â€˜Master Bill of Ladingâ€™ is a core document and data model in ocean freight, and a â€˜Segregation Orderâ€™ is a consolidation document. In the freight forwarding context, â€˜Segregation Orderâ€™ has a meaning to our users and partners that â€˜Separation Orderâ€™ does not. Whether for compliance purposes or for clarity/adoption, it is sometimes necessary to preserve uses of these terms in the codebase.
